# Quick Start Guide

## Local Development (30 minutes)

### Step 1: Database Setup
Install PostgreSQL and create a database:
```bash
createdb architectural_showcase
```

### Step 2: Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create `.env` file with:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost/architectural_showcase
JWT_SECRET=dev-secret-key-change-in-production
EMAIL_USER=your-gmail@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-gmail-app-password
ADMIN_EMAIL=your-admin-email@gmail.com
PORT=5000
```

Start the backend:
```bash
npm start
```

Backend will be running at `http://localhost:5000`

### Step 3: Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Create `.env` file with:
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

Start the frontend:
```bash
npm start
```

Frontend will open at `http://localhost:3000`

## First Time Setup

1. **Register an architect account**
   - Email: `architect@example.com`
   - Firm: Your Firm Name
   - Name: Your Name
   - Start filling the form (auto-saves)

2. **Create admin account**
   - Register another account: `admin@yourmediacompany.com`
   - Open PostgreSQL:
     ```bash
     psql architectural_showcase
     ```
   - Run:
     ```sql
     UPDATE users SET is_admin = true WHERE email = 'admin@yourmediacompany.com';
     ```

3. **Test the flow**
   - As architect: Fill form and click "Mark as Completed & Submit"
   - As admin: Go to `http://localhost:3000/admin` to see submissions
   - Click "Export to Excel" to download submission data

## Production (Railway - Easiest)

### 1. Push code to GitHub
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy on Railway.app
- Go to https://railway.app
- Click "New Project"
- Select "Deploy from GitHub"
- Choose your repository
- Railway detects `package.json` and deploys automatically

### 3. Set Environment Variables
In Railway dashboard for **Backend**:
```
DATABASE_URL = [auto-generated by Railway]
JWT_SECRET = [generate a random key]
EMAIL_USER = your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD = your-gmail-app-password
ADMIN_EMAIL = your-admin-email@gmail.com
```

In Railway dashboard for **Frontend**:
```
REACT_APP_API_URL = https://your-backend-url.railway.app/api
```

### 4. Make first admin account
- Use Railway's PostgreSQL connection to run:
```sql
UPDATE users SET is_admin = true WHERE email = 'admin@yourmediacompany.com';
```

Done! ✅

## Email Configuration

**For Gmail:**
1. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
2. Select "Mail" and "Windows Computer"
3. Copy the generated 16-character password
4. Use that as `EMAIL_PASSWORD`

## Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Cannot connect to database" | Make sure PostgreSQL is running and `DATABASE_URL` is correct |
| "Email not sending" | Check EMAIL_USER/EMAIL_PASSWORD are correct. For Gmail, use an App Password |
| Frontend blank page | Check browser console (F12) for errors. Ensure `REACT_APP_API_URL` is set |
| Backend won't start | Run `npm install` again, ensure node_modules aren't missing |

## Next Steps

After launching:
1. Architects register and submit forms
2. You (as admin) review in the `/admin` dashboard
3. Export submissions to Excel when ready
4. Send architects the image upload link (as per your process)

The form will auto-save as they type, and they can return anytime to finish.
